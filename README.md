# positive-negative-sentiment-detector-
 Welcome to our repo where we've implemented a positive/negative sentiment detector using supervised learning algorithms from Scikit-learn library. This project utilizes the Movie Reviews Corpus from NLTK, evaluates model performance, applies data pre-processing, and uses CountVectorizer for information representation.
